<h3>What is Cake?</h3>

Cake is a build automation system with a C# DSL to do things like compiling code, copy files/folders, running unit tests, compress files and build NuGet packages.

<h3>Goals</h3>

The goal of Cake is to be a first class alternative to those who want to write their build scripts in C# instead of Ruby, F# or Powershell.
